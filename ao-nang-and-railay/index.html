    <section class="content-wrapper__inner post tag-thailand">
      <p>While we were in Bangkok, Alan found out that there was a geocache event in Ao Nang (a small resort town about a half hour from Krabi) the evening we were set to arrive in Krabi. Since this would complete his "souvenirs of August" geocache challenge, we decided we would spend the first couple of nights in Ao Nang so that we could more easily attend the event.</p>

<p>Once we arrived in Surat Thani, we got off the train and it was a bit chaotic. No one really seemed to know where to go; there were people everywhere wanting to see your ticket to tell you what bus to get on. Since the train station is a bit out of town, we had to take a shuttle bus to where our bus into Krabi was located. The whole thing was confusing and a bit sketchy; we weren't even sure if we were going to the right place. However, sure enough, we pulled over to the side of the road shortly after and got off the bus with a family of four who were also heading into Krabi. We all piled into the air conditioned mini bus and headed off. The ride took about two and a half hours, and we were dropped off at what we thought must be the bus station (we later found out that it wasn't - it was some random other place in town - although more convenient). We had lunch and then walked down the street to catch a songthaew (a local bus) into Ao Nang, where we had a bit of trouble finding our hotel as there was another one with a very similar name (that seems pretty common in Thailand so far!)</p>

<p>Ao Nang is a very touristy town; the streets are lined with shops, and there are people accosting you everywhere trying to get you to come in and buy something. Lots of cheap clothes and souvenirs.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-06456.jpg" alt="Ao Nang beach at night" /></p>

<p>The geocaching event was that evening, so we grabbed dinner beforehand and then walked over to the beach where it was being held. We weren't really sure what to expect; it was organized by some people from Slovakia who were there on holiday. We walked up the beach towards them, and met the three Slovakians and a local fourteen year old from Phuket! Shortly after we arrived, another couple came walking up the beach. They were from Australia and were in Thailand on their honeymoon. Once they found out about the event, they said they had to stop by! The two of them left shortly after, and the rest of us went to a restaurant for some food/drinks. It ended up being a fun night! We found out about some really cool sounding geocaches that are in Slovakia, which is actually really making me want to go there.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2664.jpg" alt="longtail boat" /></p>

<p>The next day, our only full day in Ao Nang, we decided to take a longtail boat to Railay Beach. The longtails wait until there are eight people before they leave (so that they get their moneys worth), so we had to wait a little bit until some more people arrived to fill the boat. The trip is just a short ride around to the next big bay, but although part of the mainland, Railay is only accessible by boat. The longtails are really quite cool, although very loud. </p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2679.jpg" alt="Railay West beach" /></p>

<p>The beach was really nice - very picturesque. We arrived on the west beach, sat in the sand for a while and went for a swim. This is the beach side - we then walked over to the east beach which is mostly mangroves and mud, and used for deliveries and the ferry from Krabi Town. The west side was definitely nicer! </p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-06390.jpg" alt="mangroves and mud" /></p>

<p>We also walked over to Phra Nang beach - rated one of the best beaches in the world. It was pretty, but really not much different than most of the other nice beaches around here. </p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-06322.jpg" alt="Phra Nang" /></p>

<p>Quite a few people climbing here, we watched one guide climbing a coconut tree at record speed. There were tons of monkeys all along the fence on the path back which was pretty cool! Phra Nang has a cave system at one end, and by wading a little you can get through into a cool hidden area with some nice views. Lots of good looking climbing routes too. Might be nice for another trip.</p>

<img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-06355.jpg" alt="view from cave at Phra Nang" /></p>

<p>The fourth beach in the area is just near Railay West where we started and is called Tonsai. It's really just used by climbers and has some cheap accomodation and another nice looking beach, but requires a boat to get in and out of. </p>

<p>Railay was definitely a great day trip, and it would be worth staying there if you really want to be close to the nice beaches. In the rainy season it wasn't too busy, but I hear in high season it can get very busy during the day from the daytrippers.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-06431.jpg" alt="leaving Railay" /></p>

<hr />

<p>We also made another day trip back to Ao Nang later on in our trip. We hiked up a trail at the end of the beach for a geocache and a view, and we saw probably 30 monkeys come around the end of the beach!</p>
