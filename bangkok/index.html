      <p>We arrived around noon, and headed to our hostel via the Airport Link train. We took a taxi there from the train since it was a bit far to walk with our backpacks. Once we got there, we settled in, had a nap, and then headed out to find some dinner. </p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/62-Alan---Kaitlyn--Canada--26-28-Aug-2014-1.jpg" alt="Pridi Hostel" /></p>

<p>We walked to the skytrain and ended up at this mall called "Terminal 21". Bangkok has a ton of megamalls, with endless stores and a large amount of floors. This mall was set up like an airport, with each floor being a different city (San Francisco, London, New York, Tokyo, etc). It was pretty cool!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/bangkokcollage1.jpg" alt="Terminal 21" /></p>

<p>After we ate, we went outside and noticed it had started pouring rain. We took the train back towards our hotel, but once we got off it was raining like crazy. We hadn't quite figured out the bus system yet (and they were packed full anyway, so we wouldn't have even been able to get on), so we decided to walk the 20-30 minutes home. Probably not the best idea, because when it rains in Bangkok the streets and sidewalks start flooding. Of course, we didn't have our rain jackets or an umbrella. We tried our best to stay dry, but within minutes we were just soaked from head to toe. The side streets that we had to cross were just completely flooded, so we basically had to wade through them. At one point I was up to my knees and almost got stuck in some mud! Unfortunately we were also wearing our shoes, not our flip flops, so those were soaked for days. And, when we got back to our hotel, the power was out! Made for an interesting first night, for sure.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2263.jpg" alt="Rainstorm" /></p>

<p>Our first full day in Bangkok was spent visiting various <em>wats</em> (temples) around the city. We went to the Golden Mount (Wat Saket), Wat Pho, and Wat Arun. They were all really cool! We took a boat down the canal to the first <em>wat</em> (the Golden Mount), which was really fun! A super cheap and different way to see the city. It's actually faster than driving a lot of the time due to Bangkok's crazy traffic. They don't seem to have a rush hour, it's just busy the entire day. The old part of Bangkok doesn't have any skytrain or subway access either, so this got us into the old city quickly and easily.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2274.jpg" alt="canal boat" /></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/bangkokcollage2.jpg" alt="Golden Mount" /></p>

<p>Wat Pho is home to the "reclining Buddha", which is a HUGE Buddha that takes up the entire large building. The rest of the wat complex was pretty big too. We watched some school children exercising and looked around the other buildings. </p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/bangkokcollage4.jpg" alt="Wat Pho" /></p>

<p>After that wat, we took a boat across the river to Wat Arun. It has a nice garden around the outside that you can access without paying, but if you want to go up to the wat itself you need to pay. We went up anyway to see the views from the top. There were a lot of really steep steps to get up - I was a bit scared coming down! I thought I might have to stay up there forever...</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/bangkokcollage3.jpg" alt="Us at Wat Arun" />
<img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/bangkokcollage5.jpg" alt="Wat Arun" /></p>

<p>By the time we were finished at Wat Arun, it was around 5:00 so we took another boat down the river to the night market. It was huge! Tons of stalls, most of which were just selling stuff; there wasn't as much food as the night markets we've been to in Richmond. It was mostly catering to tourists and the middle class of Bangkok.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2390.jpg" alt="Night market" /></p>

<p>The next day we had more of a lazy day as we were a bit tired from the day before. We took the skytrain to Lumphini Park and had a picnic lunch there.</p>

<p>We found swan pedal boats in the park, so of course we had to rent one! </p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2437.jpg" alt="pedal boats" /></p>

<p>Alan found a geocache near the park, and then we wandered around the malls some more. We had dinner at a food court in MBK Centre that had an interesting card system: you add money to the card, and then you go around and buy whatever you want. Once you're done, you can get a refund of whatever you didn't use.</p>

<p>For our last day in Bangkok, we headed to the train station first thing so we could make sure to get a ticket for the train at 7:30 that evening. We dropped off our backpacks at left luggage so that we didn't have to carry them around all day.</p>

<p>We wandered around and decided to go to one last nearby wat before leaving town: Wat Trimit. It is home to the world's biggest solid gold Buddha. Interesting story here: the Buddha was probably made in the 13-14th century in India, but around 1750 it was plastered over with stucco and painted glass. It was then left in the ruins of Sukhothai without attracting much attention. In the 1800s it was moved to Bangkok and displayed at one of the wats, then moved again in 1935 to Wat Trimit. Still covered in stucco, it sat under a simple tin roof for 20 years until one day it was being moved and the ropes broke. The stucco fell off one corner and the gold underneath was visible. For 200 years it had laid hidden.</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/bangkokcollage6.jpg" alt="Wat Trimit" /></p>

<p>After eating some lunch in nearby Chinatown, we took a taxi to the zoo! The penguins actually moved, so that was pretty exciting (if you've heard me talk about the penguins at the Vancouver Aquarium, you'll know that this is pretty exciting stuff). We even got to see a feeding! Alan found a virtual geocache here as well, which put him one step closer to getting all six "souvenirs of August" (this was the fifth).</p>

<h2 id="catchingthetrainsouth">Catching the train south</h2>

<p>We got back to the train station, had some yummy food for dinner across the street, and then got on the train! We have two seats facing each other which fold down, turning into a bed. The second bed pulls down from the top. You get curtains to close you off from everyone else as well. It isn't the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, but it isn't too bad!</p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2014/Sep/blog-2619.jpg" alt="Train" /></p>

<p>We should be arriving in Surat Thani soon, and then we have to take a bus (which takes around 2-3 hours or so) into Krabi. From there we're planning to go to Ao Nang for a couple nights.</p>
