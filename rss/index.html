It was a highlight of our entire trip for me, and something I definitely want to do again.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-7607.jpg" alt="Campervanning around NZ"></p>

<p>We had just over six weeks to spend in New Zealand altogether, and we split it up into three weeks on each island: starting with the South Island. We chose to just do the campervan for the South Island (and a rental car for the North Island) as we had family to stay with in a couple places on the North Island. </p>

<p>We rented our campervan (we named her Beatrice) from <a href="http://wilderness.co.nz/">Wilderness Motorhomes</a> in Christchurch (they also have an office in Auckland on the North Island). We did a lot of research while back in Canada about which campervan was the best for us. We went back and forth about whether it would be better to get a slightly bigger van (for a lot more money), or one that's basically just a regular minivan converted into a camper (most of which don't come with a fridge - just a chilly bin/cooler). We went back and forth, and in the end we actually swapped the order of visiting NZ and Australia to get the <em>much</em> cheaper prices on campervans outside of peak season.</p>

<p>We almost booked with <a href="http://www.spaceshipsrentals.co.nz/">Spaceships</a> before we found Wilderness. Wilderness was pretty much the same price, but a bigger van (a VW Transporter hitop-style cargo van instead of a Toyota Estima minivan) and a bigger fridge. They also had a motto/vision that more aligned with what we wanted: actively encouraging exploring your own way, freedom camping, taking dirt roads, etc.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-campervan-interior.jpg" alt="Campervanning around NZ"></p>

<p>While we did have a couple problems with it (a leaking water tank the first night which had us leaving it at a mechanic for five hours, and a blocked kitchen sink which had us having to drive an hour or so out of our way to get it fixed), we <strong>LOVED</strong> our Wilderness campervan. It had tons of space, lots of well thought out storage, a bigger fridge than we were expecting, and an easy to put down bed. The van was also surprisingly easy to drive, and it wasn't too big to ever have an issue parking anywhere. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-8102.jpg" alt="Campervanning around NZ"></p>

<p>We had everything there with us at all times: stove, fridge, food, bed, even a portapotty if we needed it (this allowed us to be classified as "certified self contained", which meant we could camp in places that regular cars without a bathroom and adequate water supply couldn't). We could nap in a parking lot in the middle of the day, or cook dinner one place then drive down the road to camp somewhere else. It was so great to be able to just stop and cook whenever we wanted. We cooked all our meals, a welcome change after months of eating out in Asia, and found it well equipped for all sorts of meals.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-campervan-food.jpg" alt="Campervanning around NZ"></p>

<p>Of course there were a few chores to be done - emptying the grey water, filling the fresh water, etc.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-filling-tanks.jpg" alt="Campervanning around NZ"></p>

<p>But then you have times like this to savor.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-7758.jpg" alt="Campervanning around NZ"></p>

<p>Before we left, we downloaded an app called <a href="http://www.campermate.co.nz/">Campermate</a> (it's free!), which definitely came in handy. It can be used offline, which was awesome as we didn't have much data on our phone. There's a map with all the facilities you could possibly need: campsites (both free and paid), bathrooms, internet, grocery stores, restaurants, etc. You can turn each category on and off to only see what you're looking for on the map. We found basically all of our campsites on here, as well as bathrooms and where to find wifi.</p>

<p>New Zealand is cutting down on their "freedom camping", with many local councils adding bylaws to restrict camping to certain areas, and fines for any kind of infraction are $200. Still, we found there are a lot of places you can still camp for free, and most even had flush toilets still. We stayed every third night or so at a Holiday Park, where we could recharge the power on the campervan, charge up all our devices, and shower. The other nights were spent either at a free, or cheap ($5-10 each) DOC spot. We came across so many beautiful spots to camp! </p>

<p>There wasn't too much traffic on the South Island, I think in part because it's a lot less populated than the North Island. Most of the traffic we did see were campervans like us! We did have to stop a few times for these guys though...</p>

It was an expensive tour, but hugely worthwhile and a highlight of our whole trip!]]></description><link>http://alanandkait.com/hobbiton/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">59d03d8c-d6f5-4335-ba63-a5e9b3624bad</guid><category><![CDATA[New Zealand]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kaitlyn Richards]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 12:50:31 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02920.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02920.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"><p>If you're a fan of the Hobbit/Lord of The Rings films, you probably know that it was all filmed in New Zealand. We managed to go see several of the locations while we were in the country, but with most of them you kind of have to use your imagination to picture how it was used in the movie. It's been 13 years since the first movie was released and the landscape has changed or grown in the years since filming. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02683.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>We had many recommendations to go to the Alexander Farm in Matamata, the large, sprawling farm which was the location for the set of Hobbiton (where the hobbits live). We went back and forth on it before we got to New Zealand, because it was a lot of money when you're on a budget ($75 each - which adds up to our entire budget for the day)! But more and more people told us it was "must-see": someone who had never even seen the movies said it was definitely worth going. </p>

<p>So we went! And it was amazing. It looks exactly like it does in the movies. At the time of filming no one really knew how big the movies were going to be, or how much it would affect the tourism to New Zealand, and so they tore down the majority of the set. People still flocked to the site in droves, and the local farm owners started giving tours, and improving the set again. When it came time to film The Hobbit, the owners of the farm had one condition: they had to be able to keep the set after it was done. Since everything had been removed, they had to rebuild anyway, and so this time they built everything to be permanent.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02710.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>The tour starts off at the visitor centre where you pile onto a bus. The farm is so huge that you can't even see anything until you're right there.</p>

<p>We chose the last tour of the day, which actually ended up being a really good idea. We got a bit more time (it ended later than it was supposed to), and it never seemed rushed since we didn't have a group behind us. It was a bit of a different tour from normal, we were told, because there was an event going on in the Green Dragon pub that evening. Instead of going to the pub for a drink at the end, we went there first! We had a bit of a look at the start of Hobbiton along the way, seeing our first hobbit holes of the day! </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02707.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>At the pub, we had the choice between four drinks (a couple ales, a cider, and a ginger beer), and had time to look around and take pictures of the pub. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-green-dragon.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>The Green Dragon also had a bunch of cool Hobbit-era signage.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-hobbiton-signs.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>The Bywater bridge into Hobbiton past Sandyman's Mill, although very authentic looking, is not actually an old stone bridge, but a more modern bridge with a fake facade. Until you actually walk on it and hear hollow footsteps and see the stones up close it's pretty realistic though.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02746.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>After the pub we moved on to the rest of the set. It was really quite picturesque! Rolling hills and hobbit holes everywhere. The party tree was huge, and there was actual smoke (well, from a smoke machine) coming out of the chimneys of the hobbit holes.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02714.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>We were able to take pictures outside of most of the hobbit holes, and even got to go inside one of them!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-hobbit-holes.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>Our guide was really good, informing us of which scenes happened where (and describing them for those of us who hadn't seen the movies in awhile, or who hadn't seen them at all), who lived in each hobbit hole (well, the significant ones anyway), and giving us some behind-the-scenes information about the location.</p>

<p>One interesting filming trick they used is that the first few hobbit holes are quite small, at around half size, with later holes a bit bigger. Only a few (such as Sam's and Bag End) are actually full size. In the movies many of the hobbits you see around Hobbiton were actually children.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-hobbit-us.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>Bilbo's house, as befitting his social status, was the largest in the village, and is right at the top of the hill. It even had the "no admittance except on party business" sign out front!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02847.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>Just past Bilbo's house on the hill, we got a great view down towards the party tree and the area around it.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02843.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>At the end of the tour we had a bit more time to spend around the party tree, taking some last pictures and asking our guide any questions we had.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-02933.jpg" alt="Hobbiton"></p>

<p>As the last tour of the day, we got a few extra things. Our guide showed us an extra hobbit hole occupied by a carpenter. The details they put into the sets are extraordinary and things you wouldn't appreciate without thinking about them. For example the little fruit trees in front of houses have little hobbit-size ladders to reach the tops, even though a human could reach the top easily. In fact, since the books called for plum trees, but real plum trees are too large for the set, they used apple and pear trees instead. Before filming, they picked off all the fruit and replaced them with plums.</p>

<p>Overall it was really, really cool, and a highlight of the trip! I'm not even a huge fan of the LOTR/Hobbit series, but the whole atmosphere was great. Definitely worth going to, even if you're not a fan of the movies! If we go back, we'll visit again and try and get into one of the dinner tours at the Green Dragon.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Things we miss from home...]]></title><description><![CDATA[We're in the last month of our trip, and surprisingly, we haven't been too homesick throughout the trip, but there are definitely some things we miss.]]></description><link>http://alanandkait.com/things-we-miss-from-home/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">1f35cfa4-3670-462f-bf86-2bbf28db6c45</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kaitlyn Richards]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2015 11:27:34 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We're in the last month of our trip, and we've been talking about all the things we miss from home. Surprisingly, we haven't been too homesick throughout the trip, but there are definitely some things we miss. Here's our list:</p>

<ul>
<li>obviously our family &amp; friends!</li>
<li>not being able to be there for important moments.</li>
<li>our bed! we've had some not-so-comfy ones on our travels.</li>
<li>video games...really want to play some Mario right now!</li>
<li>watching hockey.</li>
<li>an oven to do some baking...we did make apple crumble a couple times in Melbourne though!</li>
<li>other kitchen appliances, like our popcorn maker and slow cooker, and even just some basic normal kitchen things.</li>
<li>biking! Alan misses his bike.</li>
<li>clothes...some variety other than the 5-7 outfits we have with us.</li>
<li>our car (Bullet Bill), and having the ability to just get in and drive wherever.</li>
<li>Alan misses winter. Kaitlyn does not.</li>
<li>having a home to come back to every day.</li>
</ul>

<p>We went through a period in the middle of Vietnam where we both were a little tired of traveling and having to make decisions on where to stay, what to eat, over and over each day. We got over it though and got back to the swing of things. I think we were done with Asia by the time we left though - it gets tiring after awhile. A classic camping roadtrip in New Zealand was just what we needed as a change of pace. Some familiar food, language, and a bit more freedom about what we could visit and do each day was nice. We also spent a week with Kaitlyn's cousin in Auckland; it was a bit more "normal" to spend some time in one place with family and kids and a regular house.</p>

<p>Having said that, I think we'll be a bit happy to be home in the end. I'm sure a week or two after we get back, we'll be itching to leave again though and travel somewhere new. Maybe next we should write about our thoughts of future destinations! :P</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Brisbane]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>We only had a week in Queensland, and after our 3 day trip to <a href="http://alanandkait.com/fraser-island">Fraser Island</a>, that left us with 3 or so days in Brisbane.

The city was gearing up to host the G20 summit, and in fact the leaders were arriving the day we flew out. Surprisingly though this didn't impact us at all, and in fact probably made for a better visit. We stayed at a hostel, so the hotel availability wasn't an issue. None of the road closures seemed to be a problem as we were walking or taking transit, and pretty much everything seemed to be open still.</p>

<p>We walked over to Southbank the first day, and ended up coming back here again we liked it so much. It's the cultural heart of the city, just across the river from downtown (or the CBD - a bit of a foreign concept for us Canadians). Several big theatres, art galleries and museums line the river bank, and then there is a large riverfront park with restaurants and shops. There's even an awesome pool complete with sandy beach! </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-7385.jpg" alt="Brisbane"></p>

<p>They had a large ferris wheel/eye ride, as every large city seems to these days, and since it was happy hour and half off, we took a ride to see the view.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-00431.jpg" alt="Brisbane">
<img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-00428.jpg" alt="Brisbane"></p>

<p>We came back our last day and cycled all along the riverfront past here using the Brisbane cycle hire. Just like the city cycles we've seen in Paris, London, Washington DC, Montreal, etc. but here in Australia they have strict helmet laws, so even as a casual tourist you're supposed to be wearing a helmet. We didn't have too much trouble with this, as around a third of the bikes have helmets with them you can use. It was surprising they're not stolen or vandalised, but apparently the whole system has incredible low usage rates compared to other cities. Given the pretty good cycle trails and year-round nice weather, this is strange, but cycling culture can be hard to create. We're still waiting for our home city of Vancouver to get a cycle program, but it will struggle with the same helmet laws there as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-7296-600.jpg" alt="Brisbane"></p>

<p>Cycling past Southbank we rode around Kangaroo Point, a local climbing area and around into some local housing areas. As with the other programs we've used, you pay a fee to join the bike hire for 24 hours, but after that you can have unlimited 30 minute hires, with any hires longer than that costing money. The key here is to keep an eye on the time, and before you hit 30 minutes, drop the bike off at a station. You can always take it back out and continue on if you're riding a long way too!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-Kangaroo-Point.jpg" alt="Brisbane"></p>

<p>Downtown Brisbane has a nice pedestrian mall filled with shops and people, with the main bus station for the city underneath the street! We had our first experience (of many, many to come) with the ubiquitous meat pie.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-Brisbane-CBD.jpg" alt="Brisbane"></p>

<p>Some more pictures of the Southbank area. Nice bike path along the riverbank, the local ibis around the cafes rather than seagulls. They're less noisy but a little more scary looking with those beaks!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2015/01/blog-Southbank.jpg" alt="Brisbane"></p>

<p>And the city by night was pretty as well.</p>

<p>and the koala eating eucalyptus. We declined paying an extra $18 to hold a koala and take a photo, but after listening to a ranger talk, we got to stroke one and take a picture beside it anyway. Such a strong scent of eucalyptus on them.</p>

<p>We didn't know much about koalas before we went, but we found out a ton during the koala talk! One crazy fact about koalas is that the babies are actually born on the back of the mother and must crawl, using only their sense of smell, around the mother's body to the pouch in the front. When born they are only the size of a nickel and spend the next 6 months in the pouch.</p>

<p>They had a farm area with sheep to visit, and we saw the sheep-herding show as well as a sheep-shearing! It was quite interesting really for us city folk to watch a shearing - they really throw the sheep around whilst shearing it, and it was interesting to see and touch the wool right off the sheep's back still warm and oily.</p>

<p>The kangaroo area is open to the public and you can walk around freely with the kangaroos, even feeding them with food from the gift shop. Kaitlyn was a bit timid to get too close in case they kicked her, but we did manage to find a roo with a joey which was cute.</p>

<p>They also have a range of other Australian animals, so we checked off a lot of boxes for strange animals that day.</p>

It's considered to be the largest sand island in the world and we got several recommendations for it before our trip. We debated whether we should do it or not because it was a lot over our budget, but eventually decided it was one of those unique activites we had to do.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-7001.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>We went back and forth about whether to join an organized "tag-along" tour or rent our own 4x4 and do it ourselves. We tend to stay away from tours because we like to do our own thing, at our own pace. With Fraser, though, we decided to go with a tour for a couple reasons: once you add in the barge fees, permits, lodging, etc, it was basically the same price either way; and we were a bit worried about driving on the sand and getting stranded. With a tour, they help you get out and you're not stuck there by yourself trying to figure it out, or paying a lot for a tow truck to drive out. We also weren't really sure where to go on the island, and thought with a tour we wouldn't have to figure out how everything worked. We researched a few different tours, and ended up going with one through the hostel Nomads Noosa. It was a three day, two night tour for $399, with one night on either side at their hostel in Noosa included.</p>

<p>We flew into the Gold Coast airport and rented a car to drive up to Noosa as we wanted to be able to stop along the way. Unfortunately, due to a lot of problems with our bank cards, we ended up not getting to stop very much at all, and were almost late returning the car. We had some problems with our bank cards in Cambodia and Malaysia, but figured it would be fine in Australia as our bank, Tangerine, is now part of the Scotiabank Global ATM Alliance with Westpac in Australia and New Zealand. When we tried the first Westpac ATM we found and it didn't work, we got a bit worried. We went into the bank and they couldn't see anything wrong, so we drove around trying to find WiFi to use Skype to call Tangerine. After multiple phone calls (in multiple locations, trying to find WiFi good enough to make the call), and trying multiple different ATMs, we finally tracked down the problem: apparently (despite calling in August to let them know we'd be traveling) our cards were not on some "secure list" of people traveling, so that's why it had been blocked. Since we'd been using the cards in Thailand and Vietnam without a problem we were a bit surprised, but who knows in the murky world of ATM alliances. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6836-600.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>The morning of the trip we got up pretty early and left the hostel around 7:30. There were eighteen of us in total, and we were driven on a bus to Rainbow Beach (about a two hour drive) where we would pick up our 4WD vehicles. On the way we stopped at a gas station which has the biggest cactus in Australia! Quite exciting. ;p</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6854-600.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>At Rainbow Beach we divided up into three cars - two cars for the drivers (you had to be 21 in order to be able to drive) and one car that Karl(o-os), our guide, would drive with the non-drivers. I decided not to drive as I wasn't too confident about driving on sand and thought I'd have more fun just being a passenger, but Alan wanted to drive. I ended up getting in the same car as him anyway, even though I wasn't driving, which was good! Our car (car #3) had five people in it - us and three German girls. Alan lucked out since the other car had 6 drivers and they ended up with less driving time.</p>

<p>We started off by catching the ferry across to Fraser Island, stopping for a quick lunch on the beach a bit inland, and then driving up the beach. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6867.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>It's best to drive at or near low tide (and sometimes necessary) so that you're driving on the wet, hard sand, and you have to be careful not to drive in the actual salt water. The way a tag-along tour works is that you're in different cars, but you drive close together and follow the tracks of the car in front of you. We were car #3, so we followed directly behind car #2, who followed directly behind Karl in the lead vehicle. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6881.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>We had walky-talkies and Karl would let us know if we needed to catch up or slow down. He made sure everyone drove safely, and quickly stopped people who couldn't follow the car ahead or dropped behind too much. You can drive pretty fast on the beach; we were going 80-90 km/hr for the most part, and it's only more recently that the speed limit was lowered. There were a few times we needed to slow down to cross a stream, or when the speed limit dropped (it is an actual highway, with cops patroling, so you do need to go the speed limit). </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Driving_on_Fraser_Island.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>We drove all the way up the entire east coast of the island (about 100km of pretty straight coastline) and ended up at the Champagne Pools, which was really pretty. It's a short walk in from where you park, and the waves crash over the rocks into the pools, creating little bubbles (sort of like champagne - hence the name). You're swimming in salt water, but not the ocean, and there's no worry about sharks as there is elsewhere on the island.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Champagne_Pools.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>After the Champagne Pools we drove a couple minutes back towards where we started and went for a hike up Indian Head. It's a short hike and you get a really awesome view back down over the Champagne Pools as well as the other direction back down the beach. If you get close enough to the cliffs, you could see turtles and sharks in the water below - really cool!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Indian_Head_Fraser_Island.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>We went to the hostel at the resort we stayed at after that; Nomads has a whole section of the resort to themselves, with a block of 4-bed dorms, a kitchen cooking area, use of the tables at the bar, and the day use pool right outside.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Fraser_Island_Resort.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>The next morning we got up early, had breakfast (toast, and our first cereal in over two months!), and then hit the road (or the sand, I guess!). We drove inland this time, which was a LOT different. It was super soft sand and very bumpy; we bouncecd in our seats quite a bit! At one point, our three car group got stuck behind a really slow car, while driving up a sandy hill. While Karl made it (because he's pro), car #2 got stuck! They radio'd Karl, who parked and came running back down the hill. They had to get out and push the car while Karl got it going again. Of course, because we were stopped behind car #2, we were then stuck too and had to do the same thing! It was quite the adventure. This made us glad that we were part of a tour and not having to get it unstuck ourselves - it definitely would not have been quite as easy.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-7044.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>Our first stop on the second day was at Lake McKenzie, which was probably my favourite stop of the trip. It's a really beautiful lake on the island that's filled entirely with rain water - no streams or rivers going in or out of it. It had a beautiful beach and we spent a couple hours there swimming and laying in the sun. It's a perched lake - meaning it sits on top of the sand - one of only around 100 in the world, almost half of which are on Fraser Island!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Lake_McKenzie.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>After Lake McKenzie we drove to Central Station nearby and had another delicious picnic lunch. There's a nearby short walk through the jungle/forest along Wanggoolba Creek and some artifacts and machinery from the logging that used to take place here. It was quite interesting, but the rest of the group except for one person was not interested <strong>at all</strong> and we rushed through it all a bit fast. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Wangoolba_Creek_Fraser_Island.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>We then went back to the beach, and went up to see a shipwreck. The SS Maheno was a very fast passenger liner that held the record for the Tasman crossing at one point and sailed for 30-odd years. The NZ government bought it for use in WWI as a hospital ship and later the Japanese bought it for scrap. The rudder and propeller were taken out and it was being towed up to Japan when a tropical cyclone hit and the tether line was snapped. With no propulsion or steering there was nothing that could be done and the ship washed up on the island. For several years they tried to get the ship off the island but no one could, and eventually it was just left there. In WWII it was used for target practice by bombers and only about 1/3 of the ship remains today.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00352.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>We then went to Eli Creek, which everyone floats down either on floaties or on their stomaches/backs. Unfortunately we didn't have anything to float on - it would have been a lot more fun if we did! The water was super cold, but you got used to it really quickly. We spent a couple hours there and had a lot of fun.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/Eli_Creek_Fraser_Island.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>There are wild dingoes on Fraser, and we saw one or two on the beach while driving around. The resort we were at was surrounded by dingo fence so we didn't have to worry, but we were told not to go on the beach without a couple other people after dark. We heard some stories from the guides of times camping on the island and people being attacked by dingoes. Near the end of our time at Eli Creek a dingo approached, wandering through the parked vehicles looking for food. He tried to climb up a few vehicles to look around, and all the small children nearby were quickly rounded up out of the way. A ranger soon showed up and started shoeing the dingo away.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00387.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>The third day we only had the morning on Fraser as we had to head back to Noosa in the afternoon. We also had some people from the 2-day tour join us, as their guide had to head back. Two of them ended up in our car driving and two in car #2. We went to Lake Wabby, which involves a 45-minute hike to get to. A lot of people from our group were complaining about it, but it was nice to do something besides driving! Split the trip up a bit. The lake is slowly being eaten by a sand dune; it used to be 4-5 times as big. As you walk out of the forest towards it, all you see is sand...you can't even see the lake until you're right by it; it kind of comes out of nowhere. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00390.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00401.jpg" alt="Fraser Island"></p>

<p>The lake itself wasn't too spectacular. There are apparently a lot of fish that will nibble on you (like the fish spas in Asia), which kind of freaked me out a bit so I didn't end up going in. It was nice to just lay in the sun. After this we headed back and caught the barge back to Rainbow Beach and a bus back to Noosa.</p>

<p>Overall, the tour was really quite fun. It included all meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), as well as snacks, water, and tea/coffee in the mornings. We were definitely well fed; there was always lots of food to go around, and leftovers as well. Karl, our guide, was great: good at managing the group while still being really friendly and easy-going. Most people were good at driving, even in the soft sand (which seemed to be the hardest part). There were some sketchy times where I was a bit scared, but overall it was good. We found it to be a bit too party-focused in the evenings, but for the target demographic I think they had it spot on. We'd have preferred to have more time at the cultural activities and a little less time laying in the sun, but it was pretty awesome nonetheless.</p>

We had a hard time finding a place to stay that was good but not expensive; we ended up with one in Chinatown (right beside Petaling Street) that was not that great, but could have been worse. It had one outlet in the entire room (which made it tricky to charge all of our devices) and the bathroom door was a bit odd; I kept getting stuck in because I couldn't get the door back open. It was clean though, which was good! It said it came with free WiFi, and I read several reviews that mentioned how great the connection was. Unfortunately we found it to be pretty non-existant. It would work for about 30 seconds every couple hours, and randomly cut out. We didn't end up buying a sim card in Malaysia since we were only here for four days, so that kind of sucked. It was hard to look up what we should do (and to plan ahead for Australia) when we didn't have internet.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6626-600.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>We had trouble finding food at first; everything was expensive. Once we got a bit out of Petaling Street, though, we had better luck finding cheaper food. We found a Chinese cafe-type restaurant just down the street for lunch on our second full day, which had really yummy smoothie drinks with jellies, and pretty good food. It also had free WiFi, so we spent a lot of time there and went back every day after that for lunch!</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6489.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>It's definitely a lot more westernized in KL than the rest of Southeast Asia, and a lot more multicultural. There are a ton of big fancy malls in KL; I don't know how they can keep them all going! We found some good teppanyaki food in a food court in Pavillion Mall for dinner one night; they cooked it all in front of us, and it came with a lot of food.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6531-800.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>There was a free bus that went around the touristy areas that was <em>amazing</em>. We only had to pay for transit on the way to and from the airport! The bus was pretty frequent (every 15-20 minutes or so) and had air conditioning and free WiFi as well.</p>

<p>One of our first stops was the Petronas Towers, because that's just what you go see when you go to KL! They were huge! There's a nice park behind it (KLCC Park) which we wandered around when we went back our last day; Alan found a few geocaches there as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00016-600.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur">
<img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6516.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>We came back at a later point to see the Towers at night all lit up. We happened upon a couple photography shoots.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00037-600.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>We also visited the Planetarium, which was free! It was a pretty good museum, and there were a ton of kids there. It also had a small tower which you could go up and look around the city. There was an area with lots of pictures photographers had taken of the sky, northern lights, and stars, which was all really cool. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-Planetarium.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>The other museum we went to was the Islamic Arts Museum. I get bored with museums after awhile, and this one seemed a bit too long... but some of it was interesting. Alan really liked it, though! <br>
They had a lot of information about the spread of Islam through Asia and Africa, a huge collection of early Qu'rans, and quite a lot of artifacts, rugs, jewelry, etc. As usual we ran out of time and we were kicked out as the museum shut. It's becoming a usual occurence with us.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-Islamic-Arts-Museum.jpg" alt="Kuala Lumpur"></p>

<p>The National Mosque was also really cool; there are only certain times that visitors are allowed in, and luckily we arrived right after it opened up again. We had to put on robes so that we were more covered up. There was a big prayer room that only Muslims were allowed in. The direction of the prayer room faces towards Mecca.</p>

<p>On our last full day we visited Merdeka Square, which is where the Union Jack was lowered for the last time and the Malaysian flag was raised! It's an old cricket field and has one of the tallest flags in the world??? From Merdeka Square we walked over through Little India, and had some of the cheapest Indian food we'd ever had! It was really yummy too.</p>

<p>Instead of going up the Petronas Towers, which were expensive, we decided to go up the KL Tower instead. We were going to go up at night, but it was a bit foggy and raining, so we went up during the day on our last day instead. You get really awesome views of the whole city! It was still a bit hazy further away, but you could see pretty far. </p>

Originally we'd planned on visiting Halong Bay - it was one of the things I'd looked forward to for this trip, but as we looked into it more and more we weren't so sure. The trips are quite expensive, and most of them seemed to be somewhat hit or miss, or dubious quality. The few consistently good ones were priced way out of our range. Generally you spend one night on a junk and one night on Cat Ba island, with some kayaking and crusiing of the bay and a few different islands of interest.</p>

<p>In the end, we heard about Ninh Binh, and decided to go there instead - hoping for a still cool experience that was a bit less touristy and certainly less expensive. We got off the Hue-Hanoi night bus a couple hours early at 6am in Ninh Binh and walked over to our hotel. After our previous night bus experience, we actually booked a night at the hotel for that morning only as we knew we'd want more sleep. We woke up the surly owner and got into our room for a few hours sleep. We got up and wandered around the town a bit, got lunch, quoted a few bike rentals for the next day and explored a local park and the river. Our plan was to rent a motorbike the next morning and do our sightseeing, then catch the train to Hanoi in the evening. Unfortunately we woke up the next morning to a downpour outside. We hung around a little and the rain didn't let up, so we checked out and ran/waded over to the train station and restaurant nearby for lunch. With no sign of the rain stopping we decided we might as well leave town then, and caught the 1:00 train to Hanoi instead.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6122-1.jpg" alt="Ninh Binh"></p>

<p>A lot of effort for not much of an interesting visit, but with five nights booked in Hanoi, we decided we had time to take a day trip back to Ninh Binh if the weather cooperated, and so a few days later that's what we did. On the train it's only around 2 hours and 48 000 dong each in third class, so it was easy to do as a day trip with no bags. </p>

<p>We grabbed a motorobike rental and headed off into the countryside. Immediately outside of town the limestone karst formations appear out of the ground. In some ways it was quite similar to Krabi, but with many more peaks jutting out. The road was flat, but wound around the peaks for a bit before we arrived at Trang An. The well-published boat trip in Ninh Binh is Tam Coc, but we heard about a similar and less Western tourist focussed trip at Trang An. We also heard the boats at Tam Coc tend to force you to buy a drink for the rower partway through the journey, which he/she then sells back for half price! Also they almost force you to buy some 'local' crafts during the journey as well, so it seemed best to try this other trip.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6241.jpg" alt="Ninh Binh"></p>

<p>Trang An was great, and a nice long experience. We arrived and bought tickets, then found ourselves on a small boat with two Vietnamese tourists. A wedding party was doing photographs behind us. Our female rower spent the next 2 hours rowing us along this series of lakes/streams and through 8 or so tunnels. The views were spectacular around each corner, with the limestone peaks rising up all around us. Other than a few temples built here and there, and several landing areas with food or drinks to buy, the whole area is undeveloped. Each area seemed like it would be very hard to access if not through the tunnels by boat, as the valley edges were steep and high. At one point we all got out and walked up a series of steps up to a small view and down the other side to a small shrine. We're not sure what the significance was as no one really spoke English, but they were trying to tell us it was very old we think?</p>

<p>We had a couple oars as well, and the other tourists and I took turns to help out with the rowing on occasion, but it was a very calm couple hours on the water. There are hundreds and hundreds of boats there, so it must get quite busy there sometimes, but on this day there weren't a huge number of boats out. Much of the time we couldn't see any other boats around us, and in the tunnels especially it seemed we were the only people there. We had initially thought the main attraction was the views, but the tunnels were actually really cool as well. Some were short and others were up to 380m long. Some were widened and large, but some were left mostly in a natural way and were very narrow and low. We had to lie down right against the boat frame in many places, and watch out that your head didn't get hit by hanging stalactites.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-09814.jpg" alt="Ninh Binh"></p>

<p>After the boat trip, we drove down a minor dirt lane through a couple little villages and up to the Hang Mua area. Here there is a temple with 500 steps up to a small shrine with great views back towards Ninh Binh and over the edge down to the Tam Coc boat area. The views were gorgeous and it was all I hoped it would be. We spent some time here, but had to hurry back to town to catch our intended train and hopefully get a bite to eat before the journey back to Hanoi.</p>

We found Hanoi in general to be a bit more expensive, as you might expect from a big city. We stayed at a nice place right by the centre of things just a half block from the lake, bus stop, and near tons of restaurants and the night market. It included breakfast as well, which is always nice.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-09717.jpg" alt="Hanoi"></p>

<p>Our first day we mailed our postcards from Hue, walked down alongside Hoàn Kiếm Lake, and visited the Women's Museum. Quite a large, well thought-out museum, with good signage in Vietnamese and English everywhere. They had exhibits on marriage customs and maternity/birth and how the different tribes differ in customs. Obviously sections on clothing styles and jewelry, and also a good exhibit on the role women played in the Vietnam/American War.</p>

<p>One wing had an interesting Mother Goddess exhibit. <br>

<p>The next day we planned to take a local city bus to the west. Although it's always hard to work out public transit in a foreign language, Google Maps had the transit system loaded including prices, and with GPS and data on the phone it's easy to find your way or check your driver is going the right way. Unfortunately we didn't realise there were two number 9 buses both driving the same side of the street but later splitting in different directions, and so we ended up heading south. We decided to stay on the bus and go somewhere else, so we spent some time at Bảy Mẫu Lake wandering around the park and looking for a geocache, then walked over the nearby Vincom Center Mall to watch Gone Girl at the cinema (a plan of Kaitlyn's all along while in Hanoi). The bus ride back was a little more straightforward and we got another dinner nearby.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6203.jpg" alt="Hanoi">
<img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6207.jpg" alt="Hanoi"></p>

<p>Our third day we took a side trip back south to Ninh Binh for some gorgeous scenery and a little motorbiking. See our upcoming post on the subject. </p>

<p>Our last day in town Kaitlyn's legs were pretty sore from the day before, so we split up and I took the bus west as originally planned two days earlier. I wanted to find a virtual geocache at the site of a B-52 bomber crash from the war. The plane was just left in this pond to rust away while the neighborhood grew up around. There's no real indication it's there until you arrive at the pond where a small sign describes it. Not much to see, but the neighborhood it was in was very interesting - a maze of narrow alleys running in different directions and sometimes connecting, sometimes ending abruptly.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-09979.jpg" alt="Hanoi"></p>

<p>I then walked over to the Hanoi Botanical Gardens, which turned out to not be a garden at all but a regular seeming city park. There were tons of locals playing badminton, đá cầu (foot badminton), soccer, or using the exercise machines. A odd quirk in many Vietnam parks is that you pay a small fee to enter - ususally 2000 or 4000 dong at the parks we saw. I suppose this goes to maintanance rather than being subsidized by taxes?</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-09999.jpg" alt="Hanoi">
<img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-00006.jpg" alt="Hanoi"></p>

<p>I met back up with Kaitlyn for supper and then we went to the Water Puppet Show! A well-known art form from Vietnam, it originated from Hanoi, and so we saved our visit to one until we were here. It ended up being much more interesting than we expected with lots of special effects. There was a 6-7 person band on the side and they presented a continuous series of short skits: country life, people fishing, the rice planting and harvest, sacred turtle, dragon and fish dances. The puppets all move around through the pool of water and at times splash or throw it around. There were smoke and fire effects for some skits with the dragons. Very worth the admission and quite interesting to watch.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/12/blog-6449.jpg" alt="Hanoi"></p>

<p>We spent a bit of time visiting the night market nearby afterwards, but didn't find much of interest after all the markets we've seen now, and we were nearly out of Vietnamese dong. </p>

As with Thailand, we budgeted $50 a day for the pair of us, and we ended up spending $55.42 per day. So a little over but not drastically so. Given that we had $100 budgeted for travel from Cambodia, and that we were under budget in Cambodia, things will probably work out fairly well for Asia as a whole.</p>

<p>So that's $1496.40 over 27 days, with most going to food and then accomodation as you can see in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>As with Thailand and Cambodia, cash is king here, and we used it almost everywhere. The Vietnamese Dong is under fairly heavy inflation, and is currently worth somewhere around 18 500 dong to CAD$1. It's a bit odd at first to be paying with 500 000 Dong notes, but you eventually get used to the large numbers everywhere. Due to the inflation and changing Dong values, some places list their prices in US$ but charge in Dong at the current rates. Especially when negotiating prices, be careful with the exchange rate they use - there's no point negoting hard on a price in US$ if they then just add 20% to the exchange rate they quote you.</p>

<p>We didn't have too much trouble with ATMs here. Many ATMs have a fairly low withdrawal limit of 2 million Dong ($100), but we found Citibank in HCMC and Hanoi let you take up to 8 million with fees of only $3. There's quite a lot of options for banks, but it seemed they all charge fees these days - some publisized and others you only find out after confirming the transaction.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hue]]></title><description><![CDATA[We visit Hue on our trip to Vietnam and see the Imperial City and Tu Duc's tomb.]]></description><link>http://alanandkait.com/hue/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">417a0899-28cb-4fab-b4d7-8646c3e89f7a</guid><category><![CDATA[Vietnam]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kaitlyn Richards]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 29 Nov 2014 21:06:27 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-09562.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-09562.jpg" alt="Hue"><p>The theme of our time in Hue was rain! It rained pretty much the entire time we were there. </p>

<p>We took a local public bus from Hoi An to Danang, where we were catching the train to Hue, because it would be cheaper than a tourist bus. The price should be 18,000 but we read online that they will pretend that it's more (up to 50,000) if you're a tourist, and will sometimes not tell you the price until you have already been traveling for a bit and are in the middle of nowhere. If you don't pay, they kick you off. I was a bit worried about this, so we asked the price before we got on: sure enough, he said 50,000 (after pausing to think about it for a minute). We decided to just pay it anyway as it was still cheaper than the other options.</p>

<p>The first ten minutes of the drive was <em>so slow</em>. I was worried we weren't going to get there until next week; the driver was literally going 5-10 km/h. He would randomly stop, take his hat off, run his hand through his hair, ponder life for a minute, and then keep going. At one point I figured his spedometer must be broken, because the needle didn't move at all between when he was stopped and when he was driving. But then I looked again a couple minutes later and it was almost at 20km/h! He sped up once he got out of town thankfully! We think he must have just been looking around the streets for more people to pick up.</p>

<p>It took about an hour to get to Danang, where we got on the train to Hue. The pass between Danang and Hue is supposed to be really pretty scenery; if you take a bus, it goes through the new tunnel under the pass and you miss all that. The train was a bit more expensive but I think it was worth it in the end. Those who watch Top Gear will remember it for being featured as part of the Vietnam Special.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-09473.jpg" alt="Hue"></p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-09513.jpg" alt="Hue"></p>

<p>Because of all the rain, we didn't get to see a ton in Hue; I didn't think we'd be getting this much use out of our rain jackets! Our hotel was fairly nice; the bed was incredibly uncomfortable (we had to put a blanket under us because the springs would dig into us), but the breakfast was good.</p>

<p>The first day in Hue, we walked over to the Imperial City. It was just on the other side of the river, not too far of a walk from our hotel. It cost 105,000 each to get in (about $5.25 CAD) and unfortunately it started pouring rain not long after we got there. We tried to wait it out for a bit but it just wasn't letting up, so we walked around in the rain anyway. The Citadel inside the Imperial City is where the emperor lived (with his 108 wives), and where all the official royal business happened. It was quite interesting to read about the different emperors and the lives they led.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/Hue_Imperial_Citadel.jpg" alt="Hue"></p>

<p>When Vietnam was under French rule, the emperors didn't have all that much power anymore. Because of this, they didn't have a whole lot to do, so they built these elaborate tombs for themselves. There are three main big tombs that people go see: Tu Duc, Minh Mang, and Khai Dinh. We only had time to go to one, so we chose Tu Duc because it sounded interesting and was also the closest to town. We rented a couple of bicycles from our hotel and biked the hour or so out there. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-6065.jpg" alt="Hue"></p>

<p>The tomb area was huge! It had a lake, a tomb for his first wife, a building for all his concubines, and his actual tomb. There was a royal theatre for plays and quite a bit of regular business was conducted there as a sort of holiday palace.</p>

We chose to skip Mui Ne and visit <a href="http://alanandkait.com/da-lat">Da Lat</a> instead, but we did spend a few days in Nha Trang. Rather than struggle because we didn't speak Vietnamese, here the problem was that we didn't speak Russian! </p>

<p>For some reason, Nha Trang has become a vacation destination for Russians, and many if not most of the foreigners we saw here spoke what we assume was Russian or another Eastern European language. Most restaurants had Russian menus and Russian signage on the outside, usually larger than the English or Vietnamese sign, and occasionally without any English.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-5426.jpg" alt="Nha Trang (or 3 days in Russia)"></p>

<p>The town was much larger than we'd realised, a series of high rises along the beachfront. We stayed a block or so from the water in a nice quiet guesthouse off an alley.  Lots of restaurants around and easy enough to walk most places. </p>

<p>We caught a taxi one day up to the North end of town across the river. The Po Nagar Cham Towers were built by the Cham back between the 7th and 12th centuries. Quite interesting and a nice view of town across the river. The towers are still in pretty good shape, although there are a few missing. </p>

<p>We then walked back into town and visited the main market. Mostly this was still a local market with food, meat, and household items, although near the end we did find the tourist section and the vendors got pushier with hawking souvenirs. The market is away from the tourist strip in the older, and still local, area of town. </p>

<p>We continued walking back and stopped at the Alexandre Yersin Museum. A short little museum (under half an hour even for me!), it was nevertheless very interesting. Alexandre was from France but fell in love with the area and settled here, starting a branch of the Pasteur Institute and isolating the bubonic plague. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-5351-600.jpg" alt="Nha Trang (or 3 days in Russia)"></p>

<p>On another day we headed south in a city bus to the Vinpearl cable car station. Vinpearl is an amusement park and resort on an island a short distance offshore. They have a ferry or cable car to get over there. We wanted to check it out, but had already decided against it due to the 500,000 dong entrance fee. </p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/blog-09252.jpg" alt="Nha Trang (or 3 days in Russia)"></p>

<p>Instead we unsuccessfully searched for a nearby geocache and visited the Oceanographic Institute. A mix of pickeled animals and live fish, it was interesting and a little odd. We'd heard the animals weren't in great conditions, but most were fine from our point of view, although there were a few sad looking seals in a very small pool that you could barely see into.</p>

<p><img src="http://alanandkait.com/content/images/2014/11/Nha_Trang_Aquarium.jpg" alt="Nha Trang (or 3 days in Russia)"></p>

<p>Despite it being a beach town, we never really made it to the beach. On our last day, we had some time to kill before the bus so we walked over there to check it out - but unfortunately we didn't have our swimsuits with us to swim!</p>
